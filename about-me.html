        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m a Software Engineer working at American Express, with nearly 4 years of experience in building Java-based microservices and distributed systems and reactive applications. I am passionate about creating high-performance, reliable, and maintainable solutions that deliver real business value.

            A firm believer in continuous learning and self-improvement, I am always eager to expand my knowledge—whether it's diving deep into system design, mastering distributed architectures, or exploring emerging technologies.

            I enjoy working on challenging problems and contributing to a culture of innovation and technical excellence.

            Currently, I’m focused on growing my expertise in backend systems, distributed computing, and enhancing my architectural and leadership skills to contribute more effectively to complex system designs and cross-functional teams.</p>
